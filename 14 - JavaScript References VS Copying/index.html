    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const sect = players;

    //sect[3] = "Tahir";

    //console.log(players, sect);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const sect2 = players.slice();
    const sect3 = [].concat(sect)

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const sect4 = [...players]
    //console.log(team4);
    sect4[3] = 'haha hiiiiii';
    //console.log(sect4);

    const sect5 = Array.from(players)
    //console.log(sect5);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };



    // and think we make a copy:

    //const captain = person;

    //captain.number = 95;

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 95 });
    //console.log(cap2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //const cap3 = [...person]

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
